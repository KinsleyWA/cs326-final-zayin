UMass Handicap Pathfinder (Working title)

Team Overview:
Zack Kochanski - zkochanski
Mofei Xiao - mofeixiao
Kinsley Aikeins - KinsleyWA

Innovative Idea:
A website which finds the shortest possible path for wheelchair-bound people from any two points in the Honors College at UMass. It features a map of UMass, on which you can click a starting point and a destination point, and a path will appear between the two that shows the quickest way of getting from one to the other. It could go along along sidewalks, ramps and into buildings to access elevators. Users can sign up and log in in order to give feedback and opinions in the forums included on the website. This does not relate to any existing application I can find.

Important Components:
A user can click on the map to create a route. The route is created using weighted values between several points on the map, depending on the time it takes to go between those points. There is a forum accessable to users who are signed in.
