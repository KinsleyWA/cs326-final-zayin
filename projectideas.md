Innovative Idea:
Rate My Horse (Working title) is a website in which users can create pages for their horses. A horse has several different characteristics such as size, color, and breed. A user can add pictures and a description to their horse. Other users can give horses a rating out of 5 stars and leave comments on other's horses. All horses can be searched through with different filters, and sorted in different ways. This application is similar to social media applications like Instagram, but it is more focused on the ratings of the horses, like a review website. It fills the niche of horse owners wanting to show off their horses in a more competitive setting than standard social media.

Important Components:
Each horse has one page with pictures and information. Each user can own multiple horses. Users can rate and comment on other users' horses. A horse's overall score is an average of all the scores it's been given from users. One of the most important components is the built in search engine. Users can sort and filter horses in multiple ways, and search for specific horses by name.
